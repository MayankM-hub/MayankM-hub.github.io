      <description>This is a end to end project, Scarpping the data from official website of Mutual Fund house, cleaning the data, applying automation , because it is impossible to clean each sheets (300000 excel sheets approx) of one fund house. I designed a toolkit containing different types of templates to extract and clean the data, since the data is too big, SQL database is used to store the raw data.
client interest was to know how much money, each mutual fund is investing in a stock market.</description>

He wants to follow a lot of people so that he can get noticed quickly but it is a tedious task so, using a selenium and beautiful soup I built a bot which can search send them follow/unfollow requet, like/unlike all the posts on the page, scrap the list of followers, check their instagram reels and stories.</description>
